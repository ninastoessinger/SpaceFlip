Space Flip
==========

In case I’m not the only one who missed the old FontLab feature of flipping stuff upside down in the spacing window, here it is for RoboFont.
No worries, it doesn’t mess with your outlines and only flips the view.

This initial release has not been tested for conflicting with other extension that put a button in the top left corner of the Space Center. Use with caution and at your own risk, etc.

With many thanks to Frederik Berlaen.
